An array in Java is a fixed-size data structure, meaning its size must be declared when it is created and cannot be changed later. An example, if an array is created to store five integers, it will always hold exactly five elements, it will not expand or lessen. Arrays are easy to use and  perform better because they directly access memory. This makes arrays a n excellent choice for when the number of elements is known ahead of time and will not change, such as storing test scores for a fixed number of students.
Unlike arrays, ArrayLists can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed. This makes them essential when the amount of data is unknown or may change during program running. ArrayLists also come with built-in methods such as add, remove, and size, which make managing data easier compared to the other array function.
ArrayLists do have some limitations. They can only store objects, not primitive data types like int or double. To work around this, java uses the wrapper, so user would enter Integer and Double instead of int or double. Additionally, ArrayLists more memory and processing time than arrays due to their dynamic operation
